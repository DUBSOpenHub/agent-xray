# 🏭 Dark Factory Build Log

**Agent X-Ray v1.0** was built entirely by the [Dark Factory](https://github.com/DUBSOpenHub/dark-factory) — an autonomous AI build system that orchestrates 6 specialist agents through a checkpoint-gated pipeline with sealed-envelope testing.

No human wrote the initial code. A human described the goal. The factory built v1.

## Post-Factory Changes

The following features were added after the original Dark Factory build:

| Version | Feature | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| v1.1 | **Keyword Density Ratio** | Anti-gaming: penalizes keywords in thin sentences (<10 words) |
| v1.1 | **`--profile` flag** | Built-in scoring profiles: balanced, security, creative, ci-gate, assistant |
| v1.1 | **`--strict` flag** | Optional LLM evaluation of keyword quality (OpenAI-compatible) |

These changes were human-directed enhancements built on the factory's foundation.

## Pipeline

### Phase 0 — Factory Setup
Initialized run directory, sealed envelope directory, SQL tracking tables.

### Phase 1 — Product Specification
The **Product Manager** agent translated the goal into a 163-line PRD with 42 functional requirements and 17 acceptance criteria. No code, no architecture — just *what* to build.

### Phase 2 — Architecture + Sealed Tests *(parallel)*
Two agents worked simultaneously:
- **Architect** produced ARCH.md (409 lines) — component design, data flow, file structure
- **QA Sealed** wrote 79 acceptance tests in a sealed envelope — hashed and locked before the engineer ever saw the spec

The sealed hash was recorded. No one could tamper with the tests after this point.

### Phase 3 — Implementation
The **Lead Engineer** built the full CLI (578 lines) plus 92 open tests — all passing. The engineer never saw the sealed tests.

### Phase 4 — Sealed Validation
The sealed envelope was opened. All 171 tests (92 open + 79 sealed) were run against the implementation.

**Result:** 12 failures (7% gap). The sealed tests caught issues the engineer's own tests missed:
- `--fleet --json` parsing bug
- Abbreviated column headers vs. expected full names
- 3-digit hex badge color vs. 6-digit standard

### Phase 5 — Hardening (2 cycles)
The **Lead Engineer** received only failure descriptions (test name + expected + actual) — never the sealed test source code. Two hardening cycles fixed all 12 issues.

**Final gap score: 0%** — all 171 tests passing.

### Phase 6 — Delivery
Code delivered to working directory. Factory floor cleared.

## What is Sealed-Envelope Testing?

The QA agent writes tests *before* the engineer builds anything. Those tests are hashed and locked — the engineer never sees them. After implementation, the seal is broken and the tests run against the code.

This catches the blind spots that happen when the same person (or AI) writes both the code and the tests. In this build, sealed tests caught 12 issues that open tests missed.
